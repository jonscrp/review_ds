### Divide and conquer?

Divides a problem into "a" sub problems of size "n/b". 
    (aT(n) + f(x))

Until the smaller subproblem is solvable. Then we can combine this smaller subproblems upward until we have solved the original problem


Examples:

[__Binary Search__](/binarySearch.py)

Given a list of elements a = [1,2,3,4, 5, ... n-1, n], find k 
    
Run Time:
Theta(logn)




[__MergeSort__](/MergeSort.py)
Given a list of element o = [1,2,3,7,4,3,2] sort this list
Run time 
Theta(nlogn)
